    <h2>Chrome Flatpak Beta</h2>

    <p>Please be aware of the following as you use this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Do NOT immediately file bugs on the Chromium bug tracker!</b> File them to the corresponding
        <a href="https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/issues">Flathub tracker</a> instead.</li>
      <li>USB devices such as game controllers are not available inside the sandbox yet due to
        <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/3722">this issue</a>. This also means any U2F
        keys likely will not work.</li>
      <li>Installing PWAs / websites as apps silently will not work.</li>
      <li>This Flatpak may break from time to time while still in beta.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
